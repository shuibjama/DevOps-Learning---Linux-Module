## 📚 What I Learned Overall

This whole learning journey has been an eye-opener and a solid foundation builder for working with Linux and the command line. It started with the basics—understanding what Linux actually is and why it’s everywhere, then quickly moved to practical stuff like using a Linux playground right in the browser!

Once I moved on to installing and setting up Ubuntu on my own machine, especially on Windows via WSL 2, it turned into a bit of a mission, there were some headaches, unexpected errors, and tweaks needed, but the detailed tutorials helped me push through. Setting up ZSH with Oh My Zsh and customizing the Powerlevel10k theme was actually fun and made the terminal feel more personal and powerful.

Throughout the lessons, I learned essential terminal commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `grep`, and `echo` — all the building blocks to explore and manipulate files and directories. I got comfortable with handling hidden files, spaces in filenames, and special characters. The manual pages (`man`) taught me how to find help quickly, which was a huge confidence boost.

Diving deeper, I explored how the Linux filesystem is structured, including understanding important directories and how to create, move, and delete files and folders safely. I got introduced to user and group permissions, learned how to use `chmod` both symbolically and numerically, and the concept of ownership. This gave me a better grasp of Linux security basics.

The journey also covered streams (standard input/output/error), environment variables, and aliases, all tools to make my workflow smoother and more efficient. Learning to edit `.zshrc` files and add plugins helped me personalize my environment and improve productivity.

The terminal went from intimidating to empowering. I realized that making mistakes and experimenting are key parts of learning, and that the terminal is a powerful tool for anyone serious about programming or system work.

In summary, this series of lessons laid a strong foundation for my Linux skills, from the basics to intermediate concepts. Setting up WSL might have been a bit of a pain, but getting through it was worth it — now I have a powerful, customizable Linux environment right on my Windows machine, ready for more advanced challenges.
