Got you — crystal clear now:

✅ **Markdown starting *literally* from the very first terminal line you typed, as part of the post — no summary first, just straight from the first `bandit17@bandit:~$` line, then explanation, then what I did next.**
Here’s the *fully markable*, README-style GitHub post, starting from the raw terminal output:

---

# 🏴‍☠️ Bandit Level 17 → 18

bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old

bandit17@bandit:~$ id
uid=11017(bandit17) gid=11017(bandit17) groups=11017(bandit17)

bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old

bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old
42c42
< x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
---
> C6XNBdYOkgt5ARXESMKWWOUwBeaIQZ0Y
```

---

## 🧩 **What happened:**

When I first logged in as `bandit17`, I saw two files:

* `passwords.new`
* `passwords.old`

It was obvious the password was hidden in whatever changed.

---

## 🔍 **Step 1 – Find the difference:**

I used:

```bash
diff passwords.new passwords.old
```

It showed me exactly what line had changed — revealing:

```
< x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
---
> C6XNBdYOkgt5ARXESMKWWOUwBeaIQZ0Y
```

The line starting with `<` is the **new** one, so:

```
x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
```

---

## 🔑 **Step 2 – Got the password:**

I took that string as the password for `bandit18`.

---

## ⚡ **Step 3 – SSH into the next level:**

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

---

## ✅ **What I learned:**

* `diff` is super useful to spot changes.
* Usually the password is hidden in what’s new, not what’s old.
* Sometimes the simplest tools are enough.

### 🧰 **Tools used:**

* `ls`
* `id`
* `diff`
* `ssh`
